\chapter{Introduction}

This report describes the theory and the software implementation of the techniques used to achieve the goal of the assignment, better highlighted below, as well as giving a brief introduction on what the Sudoku game consists in.

\paragraph{Assignment Goal} Write a solver for Sudoku puzzles using a constraint satisfaction approach based on constraint propagation and backtracking, and any one of your choice between the following approaches:

\begin{itemize}
    \item simulated annealing
    \item genetic algorithms
    \item continuous optimization using gradient projection
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Chosen Approaches} The approaches discussed in this report will be the mandatory \textit{Constraint Propagation and Backtracking} as well as \textit{Simulated Annealing}. Their software implementation was made in the Python programming language, and some code snippets about the core parts of the solver implementations will be shown throughout the report.
