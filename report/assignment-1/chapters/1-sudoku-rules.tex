\chapter{The game of Sudoku}

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle, based on a 9 x 9 grid. The rules are pretty simple:
each cell in the grid must be filled with a digit from 1 to 9 so that each column, row and 3 x 3 subgrid (also called "square" or "box") contains exactly one occurrence of each digit.
\par
The game starts from a partially completed grid, such as the one below, and the player must try to complete it by respecting the aforementioned rules.
